# ML Compute Practice Projects and Resources

I am teaching myself how to use Apple's ML Compute framework (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mlcompute), but there is very little literature pertaining to this framework on the internet, which makes it rather difficult to learn. To attempt to remedy this, I am posting the practice projects that I create on this public repository with the hope that they will be useful for anyone else trying to learn how to use this framework.

Because these are practice projects, the code in this repository is unsuitible for production use. However, I hope that it may be useful for you if you're trying to learn how to use this framework.
